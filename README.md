# Hello World!

I’m Marcelo, 25, a Systems Information student and web developer hustling my way into the tech world. I’ve already launched two freelance projects, with more soon to join my portfolio.

I'm rocking HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, but I'm hungry to master JS and explore its frameworks. On my roadmap: deeper backend skills and a future dip into AI. My endgame? A full-stack role where I can really shine on the front end, delivering smooth, responsive user experiences.

If you’re here to chat code or collab, hit me up!
